- Idea for a Google authenticator
	+ During auth flow (password, username phase), the generated token might be sent by Google to our SERVER (alongwith extra material like the username)
	+ This token can be stored in the database in the tbltoken table and thereon the API consumption would be the same as earlier
		+ As tbltoken has the token, can continue with usual auth flow
